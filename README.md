This sketch connects to an enterprise wifi access point (such as those used at NKU) and then attempts to negotiate an SSL connection with a website. 

On successful wifi connection, this script will attempt to connect to iot.informatics.plus on port 443.

On successful connection to the server, the program will print out headers to the console, as well as the content of a file at https://iot.informatics.plus/wifi.txt
